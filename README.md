# Scripts explanation
## SplittingDoublePages
A simple script for spliting digital double pages into two separate files. Just open your double page and run the script. You will be left with 2 new files, each of which is the new page.

## MergingDoublePages
A script with a window to allow for multiple options. It combines two pages into one. You can choose whether to put two pages together from files, or from open documents in photoshop. 

## MergingDoubleBatch
A script designed for batch purposes when merging single pages into double spreads. It comes with a user interface. One thing to keep in mind when using it is when naming the files, using page numbering doesn't have to work 100% of the time, but the original file naming works. If you select and odd number of files, the last file will be ignored, so keep that in mind!
This script allows you to choose in which order the files should be merged into the page, how they should be named and where they should be saved!

## SplittingDoubleBatch
A script designed for batch purposes when splitting manga double spreads. Comes with user interface. Again, naming that includes the page numbers might not work 100% of the time. 
This script allows you to choose which file should be thought of as the first page and second page, how they should be named and where they should be saved!
